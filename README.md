A - Why this project.
In accompanied driving, to note all the kilometers on a notebook becomes quickly a recurring task and which is limited very quickly to the size of the notebook that the driving school puts at our disposal.
The idea is therefore the following:
Create an application allowing us to count and save our kilometers without difficulty.

B - Positioning of the project.
Being a former student of a driving school, I was inspired by my driving logs, to know what information to centralize in this application. Moreover, after having made researches there is no application similar to the one I made.
